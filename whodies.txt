When your fear touches someone's pain it becomes pity;
The process of growth is, it seems, the art of falling down. Growth is measured by the gentleness and awareness with which we once again pick ourselves up, the lightness with which we dust ourselves off, the openness with which we continue and take the next unknown step, beyond our edge, beyond our holding, into the remarkable mystery of being.
Wanting things to be otherwise is the very essence of suffering. We almost never directly experience what pain is because our reaction to it is so immediate that most of what we call pain is actually our experience of resistance to that phenomenon. And the resistance is usually a good deal more painful than the original sensation.
Buddha left a road map, Jesus left a road map, Krishna left a road map, Rand McNally left a road map. But you still have to travel the road yourself
Nothing is more natural than grief, no emotion more common to our daily experience. It's an innate response to loss in a world where everything is impermanent.
Healing is bringing mercy and Awareness into that which we have held in judgment and fear.
Our suffering is caused by holding on to how things might have been, should have been, could have been.
When your fear touches someone’s pain, it becomes pity, when your love touches someone’s pain, it become compassion.
Letting go of our suffering is the hardest work we will ever do. It is also the most fruitful. To heal means to meet ourselves in a new way -- in the newness of each moment where all is possible and nothing is limited to the old.
Healing comes when we meet our wounded places with compassion.
Non-attachment is not the elimination of desire. It is the spaciousness to allow any quality of mind, any thought or feeling, to arise without closing around it, without eliminating the pure witness of being. It is an active receptivity to life.
If there is a single definition of healing it is to enter with mercy and awareness those pains, mental and physical, from which we have withdrawn in judgment and dismay. (48)
If you were going to die soon and had only one phone call to make, who would you call and what would you say? And why are you waiting?
The saddest part about being human is not paying attention. Presence is the gift of life.
The demons aren't the noise. They are our aversion to the noise...when you can accept discomfort, doing so allows a balance of mind. That surrender, that letting go of wanting anything to be other than it is right in the moment, is what frees us from hell.
Letting the last breath come.
Love is not what we become but who we already are
To heal is to touch with love that which we previously touched with fear.
Our work is to keep our hearts open in hell.
Acting from the appropriateness of the heart, we are freed from the neediness of the mind.
Our addiction to always being right is a great block to the truth.
Go to the truth beyond the mind. Love is the bridge.
It is trust in our vast 'don't know' that allows room for the truth, that allows the next intuition to float to the surface.
Death is just a change in lifestyles.
Grief can have a quality of profound healing because we are forced to a depth of feeling that is usually below the threshold of awareness.
